      Hey there 👋🏻 - I design and develop product at <a href="https://fluxfederation.com" target="_blank">Flux Federation</a>.
      My work involves many tools, including <a href="https://github.com/bluefantail" target="_blank">code</a>.
      I enjoy being the glue that helps teams translate design into great user experience.
      I’m also a <Link to="/photography" exact>photographer</Link>.
      Right now I’m captivated by the process of creating really big landscapes, but more generaly I love capturing mood, and telling a story.
      I have a background in performance design, which taught me audience is always the most important thing.
      When I find time, I enjoy <a href="https://medium.com/@mattfannin" target="_blank">writing</a>, drawing, and trying to make games.
